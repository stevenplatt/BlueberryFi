# BlueberryFi

BlueberryFi is a simplified web interface for running research experiments on the BlueberryFi platform.  
The BlueberryFi UI interface is intended as an easy portal for toggling on and off research code and container orchestration which interacts with the OpenWRT, FlexRAN, Open Air Interface (OAI) and other virtual machines which run underneath.
